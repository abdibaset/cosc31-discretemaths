    \part Let $N$ be any natural number at most $2^{k}$ for some $k \in \N$. Prove that $N$ can have at most $k$ distinct prime factors.
    \begin{customsolutionbox}
        In predicate logic, this statement and its negation can be presented as:
        \begin{gather}
            \forall N \in \N, \exists k \in \N : (N \leq 2^{k}) \Rightarrow \text{number of distinct prime number of} \hs N \leq k\\
            \text{negation}: \exists N \in \N, \forall k \in \N: (N \leq 2^{k}) \Rightarrow \text{number of distinct prime number of} \hs N > k
        \end{gather}

        \begin{proof}
            Suppose there exists a natural number $N$, and any natural number $k$ such that $N \leq 2^{k}$, and $N$ has more than $k$ distinct prime numbers.\\

            My supposition is that $N$ has at least $k+1$ prime numbers i.e., $\{p_{1}, p_{2}, \ldots, p_{k+1}\}$ for \textit{every} $k$. Since the smallest prime is $2$ we cay that $p_{1}\cdot p_{2} \cdot \ldots p_{k+1} \geq 2^{k+1}$, thus we have $N \geq  p_{1}\cdot p_{2} \cdot \ldots p_{k+1} \geq 2^{k+1}$ because $N$ is atleast the product of its prime numbers. However, this contradicts my initial assumption that $N \leq 2^{k}$. Therefore, assumption $N$ has at most $k$ prime numbers for some $k$ is true.\\
        \end{proof}
    \end{customsolutionbox}

      \part Prove that there can be no integers $x$ and $y$ such that $4x^{2} = y^{2} +1$
      \begin{customsolutionbox}
        Statement and its negation \\

        \begin{gather}
            \forall x \in \Z, \forall y  \in \Z: 4x^{2}  \not = y^{2} + 1 \\
            \text{negation }: \exists x \in \Z, \exists y \in \Z: 4x^{2}  = y^{2} + 1
        \end{gather}
        Suppose there is some integer $x$ and $y$ such that $4x^{2} = y^{2} + 1$. \\
        Rearranging:
        \begin{gather}
            4x^{2} - y^{2} = 1 \\
            (2x - y)\cdot(2x + y) = 1 \hs \text{difference of squares} \\
        \end{gather}
        let $p = 2x-y$ and $q = 2x+y$.
        \begin{gather}
            p = \frac{1}{2x+y}  \\
            q = \frac{1}{2x-y} \\
            p \cdot q = 1
        \end{gather}

        As shown, $p$ is not an integer  hence either $x$ or $y$ or both are not integers because the difference of two integers is an integer. Similarly for $q$ is not an integer hence either $x$ or $y$ or both are not integers because sum of two integers is an integer. As observed, either $x$ or $y$ or both are not integers. Therefore, the contradiction that there are some integers $x$ and $y$ such that $4x^{2}  = y^{2} + 1$
      \end{customsolutionbox}
