    \part Prove that any odd number $n$ which isn't divisible by 5 has a multiple which, in decimal notation, looks like a string of consecutive 1s. Next, write code which takes $n = 1729$ is fed to your code. \\

    For example, $n=7, 111111 = 7 \cdot 15873$ is one such multiple, and your code should return the same.

    \textit{Hint: if $n$ is odd not divisible by 5(and so relatively prime with 10), and a number $xyz0$ is a multiple of $n$, then $xyz$ is also a multiple of $n$.}

    \begin{customsolutionbox}
        To generate a number of a string of 1s denoted as $m_{k}$, we can use the following:
        \begin{gather}
            m_{k} = \frac{10^{k}-1}{9} \\
            k = 1; \frac{10^{1}-1}{9} = 1\\
            k = 2; \frac{10^{2}-1}{9} = 11 \\
            k = 3; \frac{10^{3}-1}{9} = 111
        \end{gather}
        As shown, each $m_{k}$ represents a number made up of $k$ consecutive 1s. Since $n$ is an odd number not divisible by 5, it is relatively prime to 10, which means $m_k$ cannot be congruent to 0 modulo 5. \\

        Suppose $n$ is divisible by $m_{k}$ then:
        \begin{gather}
            m_{k}\mod n = 0 \\
            \frac{10^{k}-1}{9} \mod n = 0
        \end{gather}

        To prove that a $k$ exists such that remainders start repeating when $m_{k}$ divided by $n$ we can apply pigeon-hole prinicple. The set of possible remainders is $\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}$ are the pigeon-holes in this case, and $m_{k}$, i.e., the string of 1s is the number of holes.By pigeonhole prinicple, since there are only $n$ possible remainders, and we can create an inifinite sequences of remainders as $k$ increases, at least two of these remainders must repeat.

        Suppose the remainders repeat at $k^{*}$ and $k$ when $k^{*} < k$ then:
        \begin{gather}
            m_{k^{*}} \mod n \equiv m_{k} \mod n; \\
        \end{gather}
        which implies
        \begin{gather}
            m_{k} - m_{k^{*}} \mod n = 0
        \end{gather}
        Thus, we conclude that there exists a multiple of $n$ which is a string of consecutive 1s for a given $k$
    \end{customsolutionbox}

    \subsection{code}
    \begin{verbatim}
        def PigeoholePrinciple(oddNumber: int):
            stringOf1s = 1 ## (10^1 -1)/9 where k = 1
            k = 2

            while stringOf1s % oddNumber != 0:
                stringOf1s = ((10**k) - 1) // 9
                k += 1
            return int(stringOf1s)

        print(PigeoholePrinciple(7), `has length ', len(str(PigeoholePrinciple(7))))
        print(PigeoholePrinciple(9), `has length ', len(str(PigeoholePrinciple(9))))
        print(PigeoholePrinciple(1729), `has length ', len(str(PigeoholePrinciple(1729))))
    \end{verbatim}

    Therefore when $n = 1729$, a string 1s of length 18 will be divisible by $n$
